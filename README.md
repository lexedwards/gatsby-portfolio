# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio that's an ongoing proejct, currently it's staged
as an MVP, getting my name out there and utilising Github as my portfolio of work.

I want this site to turn into a respository of everything I can publically share, along with interesting lessons I've learnt, both from a developer's perspective, and importantly for the stakeholder's position. Why I've done what I've done, in layman's terms.

## Technology Utilised

* Gatsby
* Sass
* Storybook
* Jest

To learn Gatsby, it's eco-system and interactions, it's intergration with Storybook 5.3+, I've created a template as a result: <https://github.com/lexedwards/gatsby-jest-storybooks-template>

## Previously Hinted

This site has a lot more scope to it than a simple 'Hi, my name is'.

- [ ] Engineer a backend GraphQL for the hydration of the website
- [ ] Implement Live Demos for all projects featured.
- [ ] Additional components for forms and contact to make the process as smooth as possible.
