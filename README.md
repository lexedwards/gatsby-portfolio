# My Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio that's an ongoing project, currently it's staged
as an MVP, getting my name out there and utilising Github as my portfolio of work.

I want this site to turn into a respository of everything I can publically share,
along with interesting lessons I've learnt, both from a developer's perspective,
and importantly for the stakeholder's position. 

Why I've done what I've done,
in layman's terms.

## Technology Utilised

* Gatsby
* Sass
* Storybook
* Jest

To learn Gatsby, it's eco-system and interactions, it's intergration with Storybook 5.3+, I've created a [template](https://github.com/lexedwards/gatsby-jest-storybooks-template) as a result

Todo :

* Contribute documentation update to Gatsby's website regarding Storybook intergration. ( 5.3 invovled refactoring to Storybooks codebase )
For a 'guide' in their documentation, I was having to jump around the forums to set up Storybook 5.3

## Known Issues

* IOS9 Safari isn't handling Form Validation or Requirement correctly, enabling blank submissions.

## More to come

This site has a lot more scope to it than a simple 'Hi, my name is'.

* [ ] Engineer a backend API for the hydration of the website via GraphQL - Likely, Contentful's CMS
* [ ] Implement Live Demos for all projects featured. (Still looking for good hosting options for the various technology stacks)
* [x] Additional components for forms and contact to make the process as smooth as possible.
* [ ] Create a design system page including interactive elements as they're created.
* [ ] Once features come in, do a write up on the process.
